<h3>About FlaskerNews</h3>
<p>This project is a clone of <a class="link" href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News.</a>
    I wanted to learn python by recreating one of my most frequently visited sites. This app uses
    <a class="link" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank">Flask</a> as the framework, SQLite
    for data retention, and bcrypt for password hashing. </p>
